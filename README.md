# hello-world
My First intro into Github repository's "Hello World" Tutorial

The names Jacob just started going full throttle into coding again after taking a break for a few years
it's been fun so far. Teaching myself to code through free code camp. Its very informative.
This is my first time through GitHub ever. So far I'm in HTML and CSS using bootstrap and JQuery.
Next I'll tackle Javascript it's going to be fun.
